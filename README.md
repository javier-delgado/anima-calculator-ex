### Description

This project is based off the original [Anima Calculator](https://github.com/MiguelAngelLV/Anima-Calculator). I took the core logic from it and refactored it into a 100% kotlin app.

### Features

- Combat calculator
- Includes a lot of stat modifiers
- Automatic dice rolling, allowing for fumbles and open rolls
- Dice roll log

### TODO

- Add some missing combat modifiers
- Allow calculating critic hits more easily
- Add a feature to calculate initiative for the whole party
